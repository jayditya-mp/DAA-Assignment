*** In this problem no 2 Implementation of Max-Min by using Divide and Conquer principal Time Complexity:
 O(n)
def find_max_min(arr, low, high):
    # Base case: If there is only one element
    if low == high:
        return (arr[low], arr[low])

    # If there are two elements, return the min and max
    if high == low + 1:
        if arr[low] < arr[high]:
            return (arr[low], arr[high])
        else:
            return (arr[high], arr[low])

    # If there are more than two elements, divide the array into two halves
    mid = (low + high) // 2

    # Recursively find the min and max in both halves
    left_min, left_max = find_max_min(arr, low, mid)
    right_min, right_max = find_max_min(arr, mid + 1, high)

    # Combine results: overall min is the smaller of the two mins
    # and overall max is the larger of the two maxes
    overall_min = min(left_min, right_min)
    overall_max = max(left_max, right_max)

    return (overall_min, overall_max)

# Example usage:
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
n = len(arr)
min_val, max_val = find_max_min(arr, 0, n-1)
print("Minimum value:", min_val)
print("Maximum value:", max_val)

Info about time complexity for using this problem :
Time Complexity Analysis:
At each level of recursion, the array is split into two halves.
Each comparison between two elements is constant time 
𝑂
(1)
O(1).
There are log
𝑛
logn levels of recursion, and each level does a constant amount of work (combining the results).
Thus, the overall time complexity is 
𝑂(𝑛)
O(n), as the array is only processed once through recursion.
